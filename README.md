Run Using Shell Script
We’ve provided a convenient shell script to install dependencies and start the frontend.

Run:

chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh

#This script will:

✅ Pull the latest code from the Git repository
✅ Install frontend dependencies (inside dictionary_cleaner folder)
✅ Start the React frontend server

#By default, the frontend will run at:

http://localhost:3000

#Manual Steps (Alternative)
If you prefer to run steps manually instead of the script:

# Install frontend dependencies
cd dictionary_cleaner
npm install

# Start frontend
npm start

The interface will display duplicate concepts with their labels.

Use the pagination controls to browse through duplicates.

Click Edit to modify a concept entry.

Click Delete to remove a duplicate concept.

Changes will be saved to the backend database.
